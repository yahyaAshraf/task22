Whose name contains the keyword that the user search for.
And gender matches what the user selected (Male -> Only male records are looked up Female -> Only female records are looked up Both or nothing -> Both male and female records are looked up)
System display the result in a grid (or in any other representation you prefer / think would better suit the scenario), on the same page.
